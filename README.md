## EarthBound Music Editor
EBMusEd is a ROM hacking tool for editing and playing back EarthBound's N-SPC sequence data.

For a tutorial on how to use it, check out the collection of EarthBound hacking-related tutorials on the [CoilSnake Wiki](https://github.com/pk-hack/CoilSnake/wiki/EBMusEd), as well as the `Code list` reference in the Help menu.

## Background
EBMusEd was originally written by Goplat, who publicly posted the source code on [starmen.net](https://forum.starmen.net/forum)'s PK Hack subforum.

Goplat has since stated that he isn't interested in developing this project any further, so this repository is provided for the community to continue working on it together.
